## Hi, this is my web application for Poland Map. 

### Step1
First of all, I collected the latitude and longitude of the places in Warsaw Poland. The data is relatively small since I collected it manually.

### Step2
Import the Jason file I download form Data Center which contains all countries in the world. 

### Step3
Define your own function to set the Markets.

### Step4
Design your own UI style.

### Step5
Adding the layer to show two types of map. 


Finally, if you have any questions, pls feel free to contact me. Yuqinghelloworld@gmail.com
